[center][b]Morning Fog and the Man[/b][/center]

One day, in a small village at the foot of the mountains, an old man began digging up a fig tree that had stopped bearing fruit.

The tree had been there since his youth, but in recent years it gave no fruit — not even a green leaf.

[b]“Let it go,”[/b] the old man muttered. “Next year, I’ll plant a new one.”

He sighed and sat beside the tree, the cold wind of solitude brushing against his face.

[u]At that moment, a child’s voice rose from the nearby hills:[/u]

[i]“Please don’t! This tree was my favorite hiding place.”[/i]

Turning around, the old man saw a short boy with eyes full of light.

[b]“Why do you like this tree?”[/b]

[i]“Even without fruit, it shades me from the sun. It gives light to my daydreams.”[/i]

The old man stared at the bare ground. A memory stirred in his heart like a buried spark.

[u]“If the tree gives no fruit, does it have no value?”[/u]

He asked himself.

Time passed. Instead of burning the tree, he placed his axe to the side and protected the small shoot rising from its roots.

[i]He didn’t let go. His heart opened.[/i]
